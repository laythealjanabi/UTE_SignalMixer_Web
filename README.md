**Two or more sine waves can be combined** (Added/Multiplied) together to form a **new signal**. 

The result of combining the two or more sine waves (lets call them **component waves**) is called a **complex wave**.

The complex wave shape depends on whether you are adding or multiplying and also the characteristics of the component waves â€“ **Frequency, Amplitude and Phase**.

This small tool allows you to visualise how frequency, amplitude and phase effect the resultant signal when you add or multiply the two **component waves** together.
